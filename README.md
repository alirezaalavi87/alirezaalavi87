# Hello everybody :wave:

I am Alireza Alavi, a software engineer and curious person.

My main portal to the web is [my website](https://alavi.me), So please visit my website for more information about me, my blog and more.

I try to stay away from github due to privacy and freedom concerns, and that it's proprietary software. So I host my important FOSS projects on other platforms like codeberg ([my codeberg page](https://codeberg.org/alirezaalavi/)).

There's more about me on [my website](https://alavi.me/about).

**Tools are great, but thoughts are more important**
